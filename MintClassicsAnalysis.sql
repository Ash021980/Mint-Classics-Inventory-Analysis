Mint Classics Company Case Study

Mint Classics Company is hoping to close one of their storage facilities. They want
suggestions and recommendations for reorganizing or reducing inventory, while still maintaining timely
service to their customers.

Now that I am familiar with the data and somewhat familiar with Mint Classicsâ€™ business processes,
I will start to isolate the data that specifically relates to the business problem I'm addressing.

  I'll be using an inner join to combine the warehouses table
with the products table.  I will calculate the total number of
items, products, and product lines held at each warehouse as a 
subquery of the products table.  The result will be joined to the
warehouses table on the warehouse code column.

It has the least amount of total inventory(79,380), its also has the smallest
capacity available(75% full).  There is more than enough space at the West 
warehouse, which is running at half capacity, room for @120k items.  The North
and East warehouses have 28% and 33% available space as well.

  I will first build my base working table by joining the orderdetails,
products, and warehouses tables together with a left join.  I will calculate 
the total quantity in stock, the number of orders, the quantity ordered, and
the total sale price by each warehouse.  Create a CTE with the base working 
table and the results from the previous query then I will join the two tables.

There are signs that current inventory management processes should be improved upon.
Ex. Adjusting par levels for products and discontinuing products that do not sell.

There are 4 products with 15% or less of their stock remaining in inventory.
There are 10 products with 45% or less of their stock remaining in inventory.
17 products have had 10% or less of their stock ordered.

Looking at the top 10 products by sales:
1 product has only 7% of stock remaining
1 product has 52% of stock remaining

  Less than 9% of our customers should be affected by closing the South warehouse.
Locating which products are more popular by location and ensuring there is a regular
supply at the 2 closest warehouse should keep shipping times close to current levels
if not improve them by having an efficient logistics process.

  The current warehousing process has various warehouses servicing the same customers.
Closing the South warehouse would affect 81 customers.  Properly redistributing our current
inventory to the remaining warehouses would have a minimal impact on shipping times.  The 
inventory par, minimum and maximum stock levels, levels should be implemented.  There are 
several products with over 60% of their inventory remaining while some of our best sellers 
have less than 20% left in stock.  The marketing and sales teams should be consulted to devise
a course of action to trim current stock levels, as we phase out products, and procurring 
more stock of the best selling products.
